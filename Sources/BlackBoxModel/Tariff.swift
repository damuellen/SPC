/// A data structure representing the tariff structure for an energy provider.
///
/// The `TariffStructure` struct defines the structure of tariffs offered by an
/// energy provider. It includes various components such as energy payment,
/// energy cost, capacity payment, bonus payment, and availability-based
/// capacity. These components are used to calculate the cost and pricing for
/// different energy plans.
///
/// The struct contains the following properties:
/// - `name`: The name of the tariff structure.
/// - `abbreviation`: An abbreviation or short code for the tariff structure.
/// - `energyPayment`: The payment amount for energy consumption.
/// - `energieCost`: The cost of energy per unit.
/// - `capacityPaymentPercent`: The percentage of capacity payment based on the
///   total capacity used.
/// - `capacityPayment`: The payment amount for the capacity used.
/// - `bonusPaymentPercent`: The percentage of bonus payment based on the total
///   capacity used.
/// - `bonusPayment`: The payment amount for the bonus, if applicable.
/// - `asAvailableCapacity`: The payment amount based on the available capacity.

/// A data structure representing the tariff seasons for an energy provider.
///
/// The `TariffSeason` struct defines the seasons for which specific tariffs
/// are applicable. It includes information about peak and off-peak periods on
/// weekdays, Saturdays, and holidays. The struct is used to determine the
/// pricing and rates for different time periods and days throughout the year.
///
/// The struct contains the following properties:
/// - `name`: The name of the tariff season.
/// - `v1PfD`, `v1PlD`, `v2PfD`, `v2PlD`: Integer values representing
///   time periods for peak and off-peak rates for various tariffs.
/// - `weekday`: An array of integers representing weekdays (Sunday to
///   Saturday) when the tariff season is applicable.
/// - `saturday`: An array of integers representing Saturdays when the tariff
///   season is applicable.
/// - `holyday`: An array of integers representing holidays when the tariff
///   season is applicable.

/// - `name`: The name of the tariff plan.
/// - `tariff`: An array of `TariffStructure` instances representing the
